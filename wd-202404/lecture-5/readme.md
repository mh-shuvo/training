# PHP Loops
Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.

Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.

## In PHP, we have the following loop types:

* while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
* do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
* for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
* foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array
